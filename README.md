# Starter folder

## Overview

This paper analyzes TTC delay data to understand patterns and causes of de- lays. It finds buses experience the most delays, especially on certain routes, while subways have frequent undocumented delays. Mechanical issues, operations, and diversions are most common delay causes. The analysis indicates the need to reduce bus delays through more vehicles or tactics like bus bridging on certain routes.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the autocomplete tool, Chat-GPT4o. The entire chat history is available at other/llms/usage.txt.
